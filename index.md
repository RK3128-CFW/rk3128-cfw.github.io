# Introduction 
There are several consoles based on Rockchip RK3128 boards, among them:
* Powkiddy A12 & A13 (both have several hardware revisions including different
  displays).
* PS5000 (Also known as Q500 and LINTIAN LT-8203)
* PS7000 (Also known as Q900)
* Powkiddy X20
* Supbor Q400

The original firmware (OFW) modifications have not been published by the vendor,
therefore breaching the GPL license its software is based upon. This page is a
summary of the efforts to develop an open source firmware based on the available
open source u-boot and kernels.

As part of this effort we have focused on [batocera](https://batocera.org) compatibility to get a full-fledged firmware.

# Getting Started

* Read the [installation page](https://rk3128-cfw.github.io/01_getting_started/1_Installation/) to get started.
