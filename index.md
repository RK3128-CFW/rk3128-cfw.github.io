There are several consoles based on rockchip 3128 boards, among them:
* Powkiddy A12 & A13 (both have several hardware revisions including different
  displays).
* PS5000
* PS7000

The original firmware (OFW) modifications have not been published by the vendor,
therefore breaching the GPL license its software is based upon. This page is a
summary of the efforts to develop an open source firmware based on the available
open source u-boot and kernels.
