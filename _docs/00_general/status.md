# What works
* Most of Batocera 33 functionality is working for both PS5000 and Powkiddy A12/13.

# What is missing
* Splash screen does not work
* PS5000 analogue controls are not currently working
* Retroarch:
 * GL video driver does not work well, performance is very poor and not working well with some cores. Use the SDL2 driver instead.
 * In addition to poor performance with the GL driver, enabling the overlay/bezels have additional performance impact.
