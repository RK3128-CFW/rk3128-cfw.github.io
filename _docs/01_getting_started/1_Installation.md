The following instructions provide the basic steps to install the firmware on your device, but if you need further information please follow the rest of the installation instructions and details from the [batocera wiki](https://wiki.batocera.org/install_batocera).


* Download the latest release of the firmware for your console from the [releases page](https://github.com/RK3128-CFW/rk3128-cfw.github.io/releases)
* Download [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) for your operative system
* Install and run Balena Etcher
* Open the firmware file and select your SD card as your target device. Note that you will need a minimum of 8GB but we recommend a minimum of 16GB.
* Click on Flash! and wait for the image to be created.
* Once the image is created, insert it on your console, and boot.
* Note that the first time the system boot it takes a bit longer because Batocera automatically extends the image to use all the available space. After that first boot, the system should take about 30s to boot.
